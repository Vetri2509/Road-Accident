# Road-Accident Dashboard

## Project dataset and dashboard availabe at : https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16WgFTRKgLM_inJ084thZJgSl9gk3Y_iw/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=111109787105316434556&rtpof=true&sd=true


## Objective:
 The objective of my Excel project was to improve my proficiency in using 
spreadsheets and Excel's features for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Through 
this project, I aimed to enhance my ability to organize and manipulate data, perform 
calculations and analysis, and create visual representations of data using charts and 
graphs.


## Data gathering & cleaning:
 - For this Excel project, I gathered data from a link provided in the description of a
 - youtube video.The file was already in xlsx format.
-  To begin the data cleaning process, I  created a new working sheet to work with a copy
-   of the raw data.
 - I focused on cleaning the data by identifying and removing any duplicate entries. By 
removing duplicates, I ensured that each accident record was unique and accurate.
 - Additionally, I noticed that certain columns in the dataset contained same variables with 
   wrong spellings. To make the data more understandable and consistent, I replaced these spellings
    with their corresponding correct words.
 - Furthermore, I created  new columns 'Month' and 'Year'using Excel's TEXT function to extract the month and year name
 -  from the date column as it was required to do my analysis as per project requirements. 
 - Throughout the data cleaning process, my focus was on ensuring data accuracy, 
consistency, and usability for further analysis and visualization tasks.

## Data Processing:
 - Once the data gathering and cleaning phase was completed, I proceeded with data 
processing in Excel for my project.
 - To begin, I created a separate worksheet dedicated to the analysis and visualization 
of the road accident data. This worksheet served as the foundation for data processing 
tasks.
 - One of the key data processing steps I took was the creation of a pivot table. By 
utilizing Excel's pivot table feature, I was able to summarize and aggregate the road
accident data based on different variables such as vehicle type, no. of casualties, and 
roadtype etc. This allowed for easier analysis and visualization of the data.
 - Additionally, I leveraged Excel's charting capabilities to create visual representations 
of the road accident data. By selecting the appropriate chart types and configuring the data 
series, I was able to present the insights and trends in a visually appealing manner.
 - Throughout the data processing phase, I focused on generating meaningful insights 
and presenting them in a clear and understandable manner as per requirements. Excel's functions, formulas, 
and features were utilized to manipulate and analyze the data effectively, enabling me 
to gain valuable insights from the road accident dataset
- Created buttons using hyperlinks to quickly navigate to the specified page as per the image to make the
 dash board more interactive and presentable.
